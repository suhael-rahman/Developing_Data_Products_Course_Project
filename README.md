Welcome to the MPG Predictor app.

This app is developed for the course project in the Coursera Developing Data Products course. This app predicts the MPG of a car based on its weight, number of cyclinders, horsepower and the type of transmission.

The prediction model uses the mtcars dataset. 

The app is hosted on [ShinyApps.io](https://edwardlim.shinyapps.io/Coursera-DevelopingDataProducts)

The R Presentation is available at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/EdwardLim/Coursera-DevelopingDataProducts).

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EdwardLim/Coursera-DevelopingDataProducts).
